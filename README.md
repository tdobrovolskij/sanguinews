sanguinews
==========
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sanguinews.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/sanguinews)

Sanguinews is a simple, commandline client for Usenet(nntp) uploads. Inspired by [newsmangler](https://github.com/madcowfred/newsmangler). Sanguinews is written in ruby(yenc encoding is done in C). Supports multithreading and SSL.

INSTALLATION
============
Because of some C code, C compiler is needed(GCC or Apple's clang). On Debian-based systems it can be installed by:

    apt-get install build-essential

Debian systems need also additional ruby development headers:

    apt-get install ruby ruby-dev

Now you can simply install `sanguinews` as a gem:

    gem install sanguinews

How to use
==========
  You will get a sample config in your home directory when you run sanguinews for the first time. Open it in your favourite text editor and adjust accordingly:

    vi ~/.sanguinews.conf

Hopefully comments inside will explain everything.

To upload a file:

    sanguinews -f file_to_upload

To upload a directory:

    sanguinews /path/to/directory

    sanguinews --help
